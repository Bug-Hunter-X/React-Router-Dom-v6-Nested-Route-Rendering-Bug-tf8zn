In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when nested routes are not properly handled, leading to unexpected rendering behavior or routing errors.  For instance, consider a scenario with a parent route `/dashboard` and a nested route `/dashboard/profile`.  If the `Outlet` component within the parent route's component is not correctly used to render the nested route's component, the nested route might not render as expected, or you may encounter errors in navigation or data loading.  Improper usage of `useParams` or `useLocation` hooks in the nested routes can further exacerbate this problem.

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Router Dom v6 involving nested routes and its solution.  The bug arises from the incorrect usage of the Outlet component in parent routes, preventing nested routes from rendering correctly. The solution shows the proper implementation of nested routes using the Outlet component.  The example uses functional components and hooks for a modern React approach.
